# One Dimensional Mass Spring System

Apply asymptotic expansion, we can solve spring mass damper system, which is a second order ODE. 

## Regular Perturbation 

Spring mass damper with small damping. 
> In contrast to singular perturbation problems, which spring mass damper with small mass/inertia
